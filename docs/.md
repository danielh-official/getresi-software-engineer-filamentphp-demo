# What is this?

Let's pretend there is a robust Laravel application built into this repository where our customers post their properties and are able to do things with them.

Visiting `/admin` should prompt an `/admin/login` which, when authenticated, should allow us (the admins) to visit a FilamentPHP admin panel which allows us to monitor the properties our users are posting.

The users table contains both the admins (who have access to the users table) and the users interacting with our frontend site (who don't).

An admin user is defined as one that has the following permission: "access admin panel" (either directly or through a role).

When a non-admin user attempts to sign into the admin panel, it should show "These credentials do not match our records", even if they sign in using their authentication for the frontend.
